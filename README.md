# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This project allowed me to practice my JavaScript skills by creating a rock paper scissors game that is played in the console. To play this in the github pages deployment, first visit the github pages site for this project. Then, hit cancel on the first popup. After that, right click on the screen, click "Inspect", make sure the console is visible, and then refresh the page. You can then play the game and follow what happens in the console as you play.
